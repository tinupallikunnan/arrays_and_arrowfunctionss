# arrays_and_arrowfunctions
Arrow functions are a shorter way of writing JavaScript functions, which is very useful when we start using functions in callbacks (a callback is essentially passing a function into a function as an argument).

Arrow functions essentially strip out some of the keywords associated with functions. 

Examples:
reverseString.js
Write a function expression called reverseString(). It should accept a single argument representing a person's name. It should return a reverse string.

reverseArray.js
Write a function expression called reverseArray(). It should accept an array as a single argument. It should return a reversed array and it should work for any data type.

mostExpensive.js
Write a function expression called mostExpensiveItem(). It should accept an array of items as a single argument. It should return the item that has the most cost tied up, calculated by the amount in stock * price.
